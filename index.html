                 <p>
                    Hello, my name is Farid Sawaqed, but you can call me Fred. I grew up loving mathematics and illustration and after <br />
                    obtaining my bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics, I found a way to professionally use my love of art and math together, <br />
                    through Game Development. After self learning the basics of Unity and C#, I instantly fell in love with programming and <br />
                    computers in general. So I applied for the Game Development Certificate, became a Computer Science major, and gave myself <br />
                    the goal to learn more about computers. <br />
                </p>

                    <h4>Game Development:</h4>
                    Created multiple game projects across different platforms, including a Virtual Reality game using Unreal Engine(Blueprints, C++) <br />
                    as a group with me set as the leader, a 2D game in Unity(C#), and a 2D game in Godot(GDScript). Showed proficiency in <br />
                    game mechanics, level design, optimization, and leadership while utilizing each engine's unique features to create immersive <br />
                    and engaging experiences.<br />

                    <br />

                    <h4>UI Design:</h4>
                    Designed a fully interactive mobile application prototype using Figma, incorporating user-centered design principles and <br />
                    providing a seamless experience for mobile interfaces <br />

                    <br />

                    <h4>Web Development:</h4>
                    Implemented several functioning projects, including but not limiting to a Dungeons and Dragon Character Initiative Tracker, <br />
                    2 fully functioning portfolio websites, one of which has a fully functioning in page contact feature. <br />

                    <br />

                    <h4>Python programming:</h4>
                    Created fully functioning Emotion Recognition software using an Emotibit biographical data sensor as part of my Master's project <br />
                    at Montclair State University. This project uses 18 different types of bio data from the Emotibit sensor to predict your emotions <br />
                    in real time, formatting these different emotions (neutral, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise) in a csv file <br />
                    that updates in real time, as long as the project is running. <br />
